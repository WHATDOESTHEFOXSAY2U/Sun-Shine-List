# Large Data (API Raw/Staging)
# We keep curated/analytics for the static site, but exclude raw source files usually
# unless user wants them in git (they can be huge).
# Given "Sunshine List" is large, let's exclude raw CSVs/Parquets to respect GitHub limits (100MB).
API/raw/*.csv
API/raw/*.zip
API/staging/*.parquet
# Keep API/curated/fact_comp.parquet? It might be large.
# Let's verify size before committing. For now, exclude large parquets.

# Website Data (Generated)
# We SHOULD commit website/data so the site works out of the box on GH Pages.
# But we should ignore the local cache in API/analytics if it's redundant.
# Actually, keep both for now or just website/data.
